Repository for [Particle Incremental](https://xnoobspeakable.github.io/Particle-Incremental/) development.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

## Hosts the dev server and hot-reloads modules when they're changed

```
npm run dev
```

## Transpiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

## Hosts the production build so you can view it locally

```
npm run preview
```

## Encountering errors? Check your npm and node versions.

For node:

to check your node version, run
```
node -v
```

Should output v18.16.0 (or higher, I can't guarantee i will keep this readme up to date)
(node 20.5.0 or greater is required to update to npm version 10.1.0 or higher)
If it doesn't, [download the latest version here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)

For npm:

```
npm -v
```

Should output 9.8.1 (or higher, I can't guarantee i will keep this readme up to date)
If it doesn't, run

```
npm install -g npm@latest
```
(npm 9.8.1 should be fine, but being more up to date, such as having version 10.1.0 is a good idea)
