# Particle-Incremental

A particle-based incremental game.

Latest version: b1.3.0

What version numbers mean + future plans
the version is split into 4 parts. THe letter, and the numbers stage, major and minor
the letters: b stands for beta, r stands for release
Beta:
the numbers:
the first number is the stage: 
stage 0 (b0.x.y) is in the middle of Base particle section development
stage 1 (b1.x.y) is in the middle of Alpha particle section development
stage 2 (b2.x.y) is in the middle of Beta particle section development
stage 3 (b3.x.y) is in the middle of Gamma particle section development
stage 4 (b4.x.y) is in the middle of Delta particle section development
stage 5 (b5.x.y) is in the middle of Omega particle section development
stage 6 (b6.x.y) is post-Omega, when the the Omega section is finished and I'm working on other features, balancing, bugfixes
Release:
r1.0.0 is supposed to be the final version of the game, but versions r1.0.1, r1.0.2... maybe even r1.1.0, r1.1.1 etc. might exist because I might make post-release bugfixes, balancing tweaks, possibly even updating major sections of the game (adding new features, redesigning UI, reworking some parts of the code to be more efficient, adding other settings/themes)
THe game is currently in the beta stage of development
Next goals: 
-Adding alpha particle stuff
-Theme selection, seetings menu

(this may or may not be out of date, because I'll probably forget to update this file)
