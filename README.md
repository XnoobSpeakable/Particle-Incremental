## Encountering errors? Check your npm and node versions.

For npm:

```
npm -v
```

Should output 9.8.1 (or higher, I can't guarantee i will keep this readme up to date)
If it doesn't, run

```
npm install -g npm@9.8.1
```

For node:

```
node -v
```

Should output v18.16.0 (or higher, I can't guarantee i will keep this readme up to date)
If it doesn't, [download the latest version here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)
